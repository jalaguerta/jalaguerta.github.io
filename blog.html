	<h2>February 18, 2024 21:08:03 - Image Test</h2>
	<p>This is now my third time doing the test. I'm currently working on the implementation for uploading images to the blog posts.</p>

	<h2>February 18, 2024 20:36:01 - Possible Features</h2>
	<p>I was thinking of some possible features for this blog/site. It would be good to have a post archive, so this blog page doesnt get too cluttered. I'm not sure how to best achieve that so I'm probably gonna have to look into it. Another feature I'd like to implement soon is the ability to upload pictures or screenshots into this blog. Given that GitHub pages has a reccomended limit of 1 GB, I wonder if I should be compressing images uploaded to the site.</p>

	<h2>February 18, 2024 20:26:25 - First (Official) Post</h2>
	<p>This is the first post the technical blog. I'm posting this from a Python app I made for updating the html file. I have no experience working with Javascript or libraries like react, so I this Python tkinter app will have to do. I have it set up to post this with the current timestamp and title. I'm still working out a few bugs, but it's been a fun experience making this! Stay tuned for more project updates and the for fun page of this site.</p>
